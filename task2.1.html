LAS VEGAS — A flashy broadcast studio is making its debut at Fox News on Election Night,
with LED floors and a sweeping view of Manhattan through bulletproof glass. 

Rupert Murdoch, in conversations with staff members, has pledged more reporters, new 
bureaus — even higher-end commercials. (Mr. Murdoch, it seems, is unimpressed with some 
of the sleepier ads in prime time.)

And on Wednesday here in Las Vegas, Fox News will celebrate a milestone for a channel 
that has long scrabbled for journalistic legitimacy: Its Sunday anchor, Chris Wallace, 
is set to moderate the final presidential debate, the first Fox journalist to take charge 
of a general election face-off.

It would be the most consequential night of Fox News’s year — if the network had not 
just endured the most traumatic period in its two-decade history.

Months after the ouster of Roger Ailes, Fox’s longtime chairman, the network is seeking 
to move forward, even as sadness and anger linger over the revelations from multiple 
women who have come forward to accuse Mr. Ailes of sexual harassment. Unease remains: 
Sean Hannity and Megyn Kelly recently feuded on Twitter, the sort of friendly fire once 
considered a network taboo. Stars like Ms. Kelly have mused about leaving.

So for the team of Fox anchors and producers here this week, Mr. Wallace’s star turn is 
a welcome source of pride. And, maybe, some relief.

“It was something that was really positive in, you know, not the best of years,”
 said Bret Baier, Fox’s chief political anchor, as he relaxed in his hotel room after 
 an afternoon taping.

Fox News is relentlessly promoting Wednesday’s debate, frequently broadcasting a 
photograph of a smiling Mr. Wallace in the corner of the screen. (Other networks use 
images of Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.) A full slate of Fox talent was flown 
out for the week, and anchors will broadcast from an outdoor terrace at the MGM Grand.
